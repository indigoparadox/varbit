This is a super-simple tool designed to build a database of hashes and
metadata information for a directory of files.

This can be useful for deduplication or for encrypting files for cloud
backup.

It's still super-rough. Sorry.

= TODO =
- Automatic deduplication.
- Encryption and hashing of contents (probably using external tool).
